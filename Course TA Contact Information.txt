Course TA Contact Information
=============================

We have 2 TA's this semester.


This semester, our TA's will be holding office hours online via Zoom. Here is how it will work:

	=> Each week they will be available for a 2-hour period (see the table below).
	=> When necessary, students must schedule (via email) a time to connect with their TA during that 2-hour period
The TA will respond with a confirmation of the meeting time and a Zoom link.
Please work with the TA as indicated below based upon the first letter of your last name. This is also the breakdown of which TA will grade which assignment submissions.
